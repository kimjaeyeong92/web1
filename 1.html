<h2>Animal Farm</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=40674" target="_blank" title="aladin shop">Animal Farm was written by <strong><u>George Orwell</u></a> and published in 1945</strong>.
  This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917.
  The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers.</p>
